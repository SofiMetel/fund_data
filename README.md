# Fundamentals of Data Analysis

## Overview
This repository contains Jupyter notebooks focusing on fundamental tasks and projects in data analysis. The main contents of the repository are two Jupyter notebooks: `tasks.ipynb` and `project.ipynb`.

## `tasks.ipynb`

### Tasks:
1. **Collatz Conjecture:**
   Verify the famous unsolved Collatz conjecture for the first 10,000 positive integers using Python. The conjecture involves applying a specific function repeatedly to get stuck in a repeating sequence.

2. **Penguins Data Set Overview:**
   Give an overview of the famous penguins data set, explaining the types of variables it contains. Suggest the types of variables that should be used to model them in Python and provide your rationale.

3. **Probability Distribution Modeling:**
   For each variable in the penguins data set, suggest the most appropriate probability distribution from the numpy random distributions list for modeling. Include a discussion on your choice.

4. **Entropy Plot for Coin Flipping:**
   Suppose you are flipping two coins with a probability 'p' of giving heads. Plot the entropy of the total number of heads versus 'p'.

5. **Individual Plots for Penguin Data Set Variables:**
   Create appropriate individual plots for each variable in the penguin data set.

## `project.ipynb`

### Project:
The project notebook investigates the variables and data points within the well-known iris flower data set associated with Ronald A Fisher.

- Discuss the classification of each variable within the data set according to common variable types and scales of measurement in mathematics, statistics, and Python.
- Select, demonstrate, and explain the most appropriate summary statistics for describing each variable.
- Select, demonstrate, and explain the most appropriate plot(s) for each variable.
- Follow a cohesive narrative about the data set to provide a comprehensive understanding.

### Instructions:
Download `tasks.ipynb` or `project.ipynb` file to your machine or clone the repository. 
To run the code in this Jupyter notebook, ensure you have Python installed along with the required libraries specified at the beginning of the notebook. Execute each cell sequentially to observe the results of each task.
